	Open Registers are a way of expressing an authoritative list that you
	can trust. orc is an implementation of the Open Registers data model
	as well as the more specific gov.uk Registers model.

	This repository is an umbrella for a variety of tools that work
	together to implement various parts of the model:

	+ chicken/orc - A full, persistent, merkle tree backed implementation of
	                Open Registers.

	The whole package is distributed under an MIT license and as such is
	free to use and modify as long as you agree to its terms.
